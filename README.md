# GravityForms-Integration-with-CRM
A PHP Wordpress plugin that takes information from a GravityForm submission and inputs into the company CRM. Change data fields like "loan_amount" to customize information you'd like put into your CRM. 

In this instance, the plugin uploads client information into DebtPayPro, but the plugin also works with Drip. It has not been tested, but you should be able to put any CRM post URL into the specified fields to work with your desired Customer Relationship Management software.

This plugin is especially good for capturing new leads using GravityForms on a Wordpress site. The form ID is specified by GravityForms.
